\subsection{Algorithms: }

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use Roots of Unity: $e^{i \theta}$ where $\theta = 2 \pi / 2$ is the angle on the complex plane
    \item Usually $n$ is some power of $2$ (can evenly divide the complex circle)
    \item Good for Convolutions (Pattern matching)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Notable Concepts}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Usually recurse on two subproblems, then merge back
    \item Proofs often follow induction (divided groups will fall under the hypothesis)
    \item Runtime Strategies: (1) Master theorem, (2) Squeeze, (3) Guess and Check
    
\end{enumerate}
